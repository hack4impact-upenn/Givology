<br><b>Summary</b>: What's the difference between a single million-dollar donation versus a million one-dollar donations? With technological advances reducing transaction costs and increasing usage of P2P social networking sites, the Internet has fundamentally revolutionized education philanthropy, empowering information sharing to make giving by individuals much more targeted, transparent, and rewarding. This in-depth case study on Givology seeks to discuss microphilanthropy's implications for education, its benefits and limitations, potential risks, and future opportunities.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.50dollars.org" target="_blank" target="_blank">Givology's $50 Campaign for the Peace School (April 2010)</a>
<br>What would you buy for $50? We asked this question to more than 150 kids in Uganda from rural villages to the sprawling capital city of Kampala. The kids responded with drawings of what they would buy if they had $50. From school fees and banana trees to iPhones and laptops, their drawings reveal so much about their aspirations
and the obstacles they face. With attendance by the Permanent Mission of Uganda to United Nations,
Uganda American Association of Greater New York, and Joanita Senoga,
founder of the Circle of Peace School on opening night, the exhibition raised
awareness for the Circle of Peace School and Uganda as a whole. This campaign was created by Jiashan Wu, artist/designer, in collaboration with Joyce Meng, founding CEO of Givology. 100% of the proceeds go to support the Peace School.
