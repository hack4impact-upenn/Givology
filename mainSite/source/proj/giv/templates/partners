For areas without a computer or Internet, Phelex always donates a computer to their partner schools, hence providing an easy method for teachers and students to maintain communication with Givology. </p>

<p><b>Description</b>: Peach stands for Promoting Education, Art, and Community Harvest. Created by a group of U.S. citizens in 2001, Peach Foundation is a California non-profit organization with no political or religious affiliations. The Peach Foundation was formed to help children from the poorest parts of China obtain an opportunity to complete a college education. The Foundation makes arrangement with local regions to elect qualified teachers, who are then entrusted to recommend students based on financial need and academic potential. After a stringent evaluation process, selected students will receive financial assistance directly in the form of a scholarship. The teachers from the local regions are responsible for communicating with the Peach Foundation and for handling matters related to this task. Each year, appointed volunteers representing the Foundation will travel to various regions in China at their own expense to evaluate the program. Since 2002, Peach has also published its own annual reports that summarize their progress.</p>

<p><b>Interactions with Givology</b>: Givology and PEACH are very complementary, as one offers a platform for expansion and visibility for the other. Together, we work to fund an increasingly large base of students in China. PEACH has offered an initial twenty student profiles of $250.00 in requested donation per child, and maintains regular visits to track the progress of the student. </p>

<p><b>Description</b>: Ahelp was founded in 2004 in China. It is a non-profit NGO focusing on helping education for low-income students that channel funds through the school. Serving as a bridge between donors and children in need, it has had a track record of helping over 2,200 children obtain long-term education from middle through high school (with a focus on high school tuition fees due to Nine Year Compulsory Education Act in China). Ahelp also sets up projects for its schools. In the past, it has helped build over forty libraries for schools and mobilized visits to 600 villages and 6,000 student families in 3 provinces. In total, it has delivered over two million Yuan delivered to schools and students. Some numbers that it reports:</p>

<ul style="font-size:90%">
  <li>Over 8000 forum members worldwide</li>
  <li>Over 500 volunteers worldwide</li>
  <li>Over 1000 donors worldwide</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Interactions with Givology</b>: Givology and Ahelp are testing a partnership, mainly through sharing web resources and student information. As all of Ahelp's operations are in Chinese and its current population of supporters are solely Chinese, Givology aims to become the international arm of Ahelp. Ahelp's methodologies of collecting information and displaying it to potential donors on a blog-like site closely parallel that of Givology's. Going forward, Ahelp will direct traffic to Givology for an increasingly larger number of student profiles. For Givology users, Ahelp's link will also be available.</p>
