The idea of Givology came to <b>Joyce Meng</b> when she started thinking about ways to leverage online social networking communities to support education worldwide. Joyce is a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University (Balliol College), reading for a MsC in Economics for Development. She graduated from the Huntsman Program of International Studies and Business at the University of Pennsylvania, majoring in Finance and International Studies with minors in Mathematics and Spanish.<br/><br/>
Joyce is deeply interested in microfinance and international development, with particular focus on social entrepreneurship. In microfinance, she has done field work and social impact assessment research with FINCA International, the Nantik Lum Foundation, and Opportunity International. Her experiences in rural villages instilled in her the belief that poverty should never be tolerated - that if given the opportunity, the poor can creatively transform their lives and the lives of their children.<br/><br/>
Joyce believes that Internet microphilanthropy is a powerful tool to enable individuals to make a difference. She considers education as one of the most important and sustainable resources for individual empowerment, advancement, and poverty alleviation. Givology is a manifestation of her dream of making high quality education accessible to aspiring students throughout the world.<br/><br/>

Other than Givoloy, he is involved with various other organizations and ventures. He serves on the national Youth Advisory Council and consults on the marketing team for Do Something, North America's leading teen-based non-profit, and the Alliance Youth Network (a national advisory team comprised of high school, college and graduate students from America's largest non-profits) for America's Promise Alliance, the largest association of its kind of non-profits and service organizations.

<b>Julia Gooding</b> grew up in the rural northeast US, but through spending time in Latin America, Europe, and many parts of Asia, saw first-hand how limited educational opportunities can significantly restrict individual and communal prosperity and well-being. Her passion for international development grew with her desire to create educational opportunities for others, and led to her participation in Givology. Julia graduated from Colgate University in 2008 with a double major in Asian Studies and Spanish. After graduation, she spent over a year in China on a Fulbright research grant studying rural and urban Buddhist communities. After returning to the US, Julia worked on socially responsible investing, and with a Buddhist education nonprofit that brought her back to mainland China and Taiwan in summer 2010. Julia now works at China Labor Watch and is based in New York City. She also enjoys cooking, hiking in Maine, biking around New York, and playing with her French bulldog, Lola.

<h3>Fellows</h3>
Our Givology Fellows serve as the "ears and eyes" of our community. They visit our partners in the field, conduct research about education in the developing world, and write about the lessons and discoveries they make in our <a href="https://www.givology.org/notesfromthefield/"><b>Notes from the Field</b></a> Journal. Since not all of us have the opportunity to travel, the blog entries and reflections of our fellows are really important in shedding light on some of the most difficult challenges in providing access to quality education.<br><br>

<h3>Chapters</h3>
<b>Givology Chapters</b> are volunteer-driven organizations that are affiliated with Givology. In support of Givology's mission, Givology Chapters recruit their own volunteers, establish their own goals, and devise their own strategies. Givology chapters not only contribute by raising funding to support community-driven education initiatives and student scholarships throughout the world, but also identify strategic partnerships for Givology and increase awareness locally about issues confronting education in the developing world. Starting a Givology chapter is a way to make an impact and run your own nonprofit!</br></br>
