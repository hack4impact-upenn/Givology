<img src="/images/getinvolved.jpg" style="margin-left:25px;margin-right:15px;padding:0;float:right;"><p>Our volunteers are indispensable assets to our work and we welcome you to join us in any way you can. There are many ways to get involved: </p>

<ul style="font-size:90%">

  <li>Apply to our <a href="/fellowships/">fellowship</a> and <a href="/internships/">internship</a> programs </li>

  <li> Spread the word</a> about Givology to your family and friends </li>
  <li> Hold a <b>fundraiser</b> for Givology in your community</li>
</ul>

<p>Join our daily operations as a volunteer for one of the following functions: </p>

<ul style="font-size:90%">
  <li><b>Outreach/Marketing/Public Relations</b>: Help us promote and spread the word about Givology by becoming involved with our outreach programs.</li>
  <br><li><b>Fundraising/Sponsorship</b>: To ensure that donations are maximized to the benefit of the student/project recipient, Givology funds its own operations through the help of sponsorships and grants. Get involved with our sponsorship activities to help Givology secure grants and fundraising.</li> 
  <br><li><b>Research</b>: This committee is primarily responsible for conducting research on education in developing nations as well as scoping out potential partner organizations. Help us dictate the future of how/where Givology expands.</li>
  <br><li><b>Technology</b>: Our Tech committee designs and maintains our website while also shouldering the responsibility of all technical matters pertaining to Givology.</li>
  <br><li><b>Translation</b>: Although Givology employs English as its internal communication language, our external communication varies between English and Chinese (and potentially many more languages as we expand globally). Our Translation committee is primarily responsible for the translation of materials from English to Chinese (or vice versa) such as brochures, reports, announcements, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are interested in assisting in the above functions, please send Catherine Gao a <b>resume</b> and a <b>short letter</b> detailing your interest and time availability at <a href="mailto:catherine.gao@givology.org">catherine.gao@givology.org</a>.
