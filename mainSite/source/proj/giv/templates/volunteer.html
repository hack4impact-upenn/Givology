<a name="2v"><p><b>Start/join a Givology chapter</b></a>: Givology chapters are affiliated groups that work closely with our team to make a difference in their local communities. Often taking the form of school clubs or independent volunteer groups, Givology chapters recruit volunteers, establish their annual goals, hold fundraising and awareness building events in their local community, and serve as ambassadors of Givology. Our chapters are core to our strength - we rely on our chapters to raise funding through events, spread awareness about our education causes, brainstorm and execute creative campaigns, and help us connect with more people. Starting a Givology chapter is a powerful way to make an impact and inspire your community to act! <a href="/get-involved/start-chapter/">Check out our chapters page for more details and to find a chapter near you!</a>. </p>		
<a name="3v"><p><b>Apply to our fellowship and internship programs</b></a>: Givology internships provide you hands-on non-profit experience, while a fellowship gives you a chance to travel abroad and interact with our students and families. Interns work closely with members of the Givology executive team, and have the opportunity to gain practical skills in public relations, marketing, communications, fundraising, finance, technology, and social media, among other functions. Given our 100% volunteer philosophy, we give interns a unique opportunity to lead a project and to come up with creative solutions to help us achieve our mission. For those looking for an experience abroad, our fellows serve as our eyes and ears by visiting our field partners and volunteering in their programs, while helping us collect updates, document impact, and conduct diligence. Furthermore, our fellows pursue education research and consulting projects and blog about their experiences for our website and newsletter. Please check out our <a href="/get-involved/internships/">internships page</a> and <a href="/get-involved/fellowships/">fellowships page</a> for more details about the program, the application progress, and the requirements.</p>
