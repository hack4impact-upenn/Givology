<p>The formation and management of partnerships constitutes the backbone of Givology's field operations, and more importantly, the foundation of our credibility. Since our partners are responsible for disbursing the funds to the student / project and providing periodic progress updates from the student / project, Givology requires that potential partners meets the following standards: </p>

<ol style="font-size:90%">
  <li><b>501-(c)3 status (or equivalent) or official institutions of education</b> (i.e. local schools or universities) - Non-profit organizations based in the United States should have tax exemption status. NGOs abroad have to meet accountability standards in accordance to the law of the base country. Official institutions of education should have documentation proving legitimacy of operations.  </li>
  <br><li><b>2+ years of field experience</b> - Givology mainly partners with established organizations that have deep operational experience and commitments to local communities and villages. Ideally, the partner organization would have local branches situated nearby the villages, since partners are required to provide periodic updates on the progress of the sponsored student or project. </li>
  <br><li><b>Completion of Partner Application Form</b> - To become a partner, Givology requests that each organization fills out a form that describes the organization's main achievements (i.e. number of students helped, amount of funding raised, awards for social impact, etc.), history, management team, and operational experience (i.e. geographic location and branches, number of staff, outreach strategy, overhead as a % of total resources). The form comprehensively addresses the key issues in building credible, lasting partnerships. The form is available here</li> 
  <br><li><b>Interview</b> - Givology first screens potential partners through a 30-minute phone interview to clarify questions in the application and to develop a better understanding of the partner's operations and mission. If feasible, we will make travel arrangements to visit your organization. </li>
  <br><li><b>Further Documentation</b> - Givology may request potential partners to provide additional documentation, including letters of support.</li>
</ol>
