	Since Givology does not use any online donations to cover
	operational costs and overhead, our success depends largely on the
	generous contributions of supporters like you. Your sponsorship will
	provide direct assistance towards our fellowship program, due
	diligence procedures, maintenance of our web-site, and support for
	our partnerships. Sponsorship can be in the form of an online donation 
	direct to Givology, an in-kind contribution, or simply hosting a fundraiser
	for Givology in your local community! Click here to download our <a href="/static/mediapackage.pdf" target="_blank">media package</a>, which provides an overview of our activities, operations, and events to date.

<h1>Hosting a Givology Event or Fundraiser</h1>

<p>Givology encourages everyone to host fundraisers and awareness building events in your community to support our cause and mission. Holding a Givology fundraiser is one great way to make a difference!  The Givology team will be there to provide assistance throughout the process. </p>
<p> A Givology event is any occasion that spreads awareness of Givology, raises funds for Givology, and/or engages members of your local community in an activity that supports Givology's mission. It is an opportunity for you to educate, inspire and motivate your guests to contribute to the students and projects on Givology and get involved! </p>
<p>In the past, we have collaborated with individuals and organizations to host several successful Givology events, including a banquet fundraiser and a highly anticipated Givology-themed brunch. These events have raised significant funds for Givology, while helping us connect to different networks and communities. By hosting a fundraiser, you make an important contribution to Givology, while having a fun night out with friends! </p>
<p>The following are some potential event ideas - please refer to our <b><u><a href="/static/givactivities.doc">Givology Activities guidebook</b></u></a> for more suggestions on fun, creative events to hold.</p>

<ul style="font-size:90%">
  <li><b>Poker Night</b>: Bet the night away! Buy-ins go to Givology and the winner can choose the student or project to support on our site</li>
  <li><b>Auction Night</b>: Try to get people to donate a gift, the promise of their time, or use of their belongings and auction them off.</li>
  <li><b>Dinner Out</b>: Work with a local restaurant to set aside one evening where a portion of the profits goes toward Givology. Ask your friends to dine at the restaurant that night!</li>
  <li><b>Movie showing</b>: Selecting a documentary with a message complimentary to that of Givology.</li>
  <li><b>House party</b>: Host a party for friends and family! This creates an opportunity for you to tell people about Givology in a social setting, and a chance for them to ask questions. Instead of bringing wine, ask your guests to make a donation in your name instead.</li>
  <li><b>Come Dine with Me</b>: Create your own version of the popular TV show. You and a few friends all host a dinner party. At the end of each evening you all rate the food and the host's performance. Make a donation to take part.</li>
    </ul>

	<p><b>The options are limitless - be creative!</b> We welcome all individuals with event ideas to contact us. You can be a student involved in a community service club, a professional interested in introducing Givology to your company, a service organization looking to contribute to a worthy case, a business willing to donate a portion of your proceeds to Givology, etc. </p>
  <p>Pease email us at <a href="mailto:info@givology.org">info@givology.org</a> with a short self-introduction and a brief description of the event you are envisioning. Givology is excited to hear your ideas and we look forward to working with you to ensure the success of your event!</p>
