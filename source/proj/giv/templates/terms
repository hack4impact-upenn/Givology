<h1>Givology Terms of Use Agreement</h1>
<p><b>Givology is a Pennsylvania-based non-profit public benefit corporation (together with its officers, directors, agents, employees, partners and their respective affiliates, collectively, "Givology"). This Terms of Use Agreement (this "Agreement") is a contract between you ("you") and Givology and governs all transactions between you and Givology, as well as your use of the Givology.org website (the "Website") and all its services. By using the Website, you agree to be bound by this Agreement, whether or not you become a donor, participate in Givology's fellowship or volunteer programs (the "Program") or general use of the Website (in each such capacity, a "User"). If you wish to become a donor, participate in the Program or otherwise become a User of the Website, you must read all of the terms and conditions in, and linked to, this Agreement (including the <a href="/policy/">Privacy Policy</a>)</b></p>
<p>This Agreement supersedes any previous Agreement to which you and Givology may have been bound. This Agreement may be modified by Givology in its sole discretion from time to time and such modifications will become part of this Agreement and will be effective once posted by Givology on the Website. Your participation in the Program and use of the Website will be subject to any such modifications. You should review the Website and this Agreement periodically for any modifications.</p>
<p>This Agreement will be binding on, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable against the parties and their respective successors and assigns. Neither the course of conduct between parties nor trade practice shall act to modify any provision of the Agreement. All rights not expressly granted herein are hereby reserved. Headings are for reference purposes only and in no way define, limit, construe or describe the scope or extent of such section.</p>
<p><b>1. Participation in the Program</b></p>
<p>Givology manages the Website, which pairs you and other persons (each, a "Donor" and, collectively, "Donors") with struggling students in developing countries (each, a "Recipient" and, collectively, "Recipients") in order for them to continue their education. Givology undergoes rigorous compliance checks to ensure our partner organizations have a bona fide charitable purpose and meet applicable laws relating to international philanthropy. Given that these students often times come from remote locations where communication and transportation may be difficult, we ask that donors remain patient with student updates and monitoring, which may range from weekly/monthly to semesterly/annually, depending on our partner's organizations. <b>Additionally, it is difficult to predict the amount of transaction fees among international bank transfers, and thus, the amount that reaches the Recipient will differ accordingly relative to the Donor's expected donation amount. Givology assures you that we will minimize transaction costs in our money transfers, as we are fully committed to maximize the value of a dollar to help our students and projects.</b></p>
<p><b>By participating in the Program or otherwise using this Website, you hereby acknowledge and agree that (a) Givology makes no representation, warranty, covenant or guarantee that any funds you give to a Recipient via the Website will reported back to the Donor.</b></p>
<p><b>1.1. Grant Disbursement.</b> You understand that Givology identifies existing international organizations (each, a "Field Partner" and, collectively, "Field Partners") that work in developing countries and have a mission to increase access to education by providing education grants and funding to low-income students and communities in need of support. Any donation made by you or any other Donor will be disbursed to Field Partners for ultimate disbursement to each Recipient you have selected for receipt of a Grant. Givology aggregates funds from multiple Donors via the Website and passes 100% of these funds (excluding the interest earned, if any, on such funds while they are held in Givology's account, which is contributed to fund Givology's operations) to the Field Partner(s) for disbursement to the Recipients selected for funding on the Website. However, there will be deductions taken by the bank in executing international transactions. The transaction fee will vary according to country. Documentation of transaction fee can be made available upon request, but Givology will make its best effort at benchmarking fees and finding the lowest rate. Givology is merely a middle-man in the transaction process. Field Partners are solely responsible for screening each Recipient and obtaining follow-up documentations for the Website, and Givology (a) expressly disclaims any responsibility to screen any Recipient or any Field Partner, and (b) shall have no liability whatsoever and you shall hold Givology harmless from, any and all liabilities with respect to, or resulting from such screenings.</p>
<p><b>1.2 Grant Follow-up and Updates.</b> After Recipients obtain the Grants, the Field Partner(s) will post available documentation to the Website. Subsequently, the Field Partner(s) will attempt to regularly follow-up on the usage of funds and obtain any update information on the Recipient(s). The format of the updates is not consistent and depends on the Field Partner and Donor circumstances, both resources and time. You understand, however, that you may be able to demand whatever donation you originally disbursed and any potential updates.</p>
<p><b>1.3 Tax Deductibility.</b> You understand that Givology is currently under fiscal sponsorship from its Field Partner, Phelex Foundation. The Phelex Foundation is a 501(c)(3) operating charity based in Massachusetts, the United States. Founded in 1995 by a group of Boston-area residents, the foundation actively promotes basic education for financially, socially or physically disadvantaged children in the poverty-stricken regions of rural Asia. Under Phelex Foundation"s fiscal sponsorship, donations to students and projects through Givology are 100% tax deductible. </p>
<p>Givology is also pending approval to become an independent non-profit public benefit corporation that qualifies as a public charity under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended from time to time. <b>You also understand that you are solely responsible for determining the proper tax treatment for any Grant you make through the Website and the Program. Givology has not and will not provide any tax or legal advice to you in connection with any Grant you might make.</b> This Agreement does not attempt to define the tax implications of participating in the Program. If you participate in the Program, you should consult with your own accountants, tax and legal advisors.</p>
<p><b>1.4. Grant Records.</b> Records of each Grant you make (including this Agreement and any repayment history) will be kept by Givology and upon your request, can be made available to you at any time throughout the term of the Grant. </p>
